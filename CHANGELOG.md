# CHANGELOG · Mila Companion

## Unreleased
- `mila-export` — `mila export` / `mila restore`: the whole Mila (instructions, skills, memory, crons, settings, plugin list) in one `tar.gz` with `manifest.json` (format 1, sha256) and `RESTORE.md`; built-in secret scanner, the export fails on a hit; restore verifies, never overwrites, prints a re-enter checklist. `release.json` gets `genes` (every Mila carries mila-export and mila-update).

## v1.0 · first release
Mila Companion — a personal AI companion in Telegram that runs on the owner's Claude subscription.

**Highlights**
- `bot-send` — messages and mailings through the owner's public bot: the companion files a request, a host-side gate holds the bot token; only people who wrote to the bot; preview → owner's ✅; rate limit, stop list, quiet hours.
- `send-guard` hook with `"onFailure": "block"` (Claude Code 2.1.295+): if the guard fails or hangs, the message is not sent at all rather than sent unchecked.
- `packs/webmaster` (optional): site development and production deploys by the companion itself.
- `yasno` — the language of owner-facing cards: clear on first read, 9 rules in the spirit of ASD-STE100, a glossary, `yasno_check.py`.
- `mila-update` — the companion knows her core version, compares it with the release, updates only after the owner's yes, with backup and rollback. `release.json` lists what is updated and what never is.
